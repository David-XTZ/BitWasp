BitWasp is an open source PHP project which allows anyone to set up a secure bitcoin marketplace independent of other centralized services.
It features multi-signature transactions, meaning no live wallet to steal. Users can also recover their funds from the site if it goes offline.

I forked this project, in the hope that there's still demand for this app.
Please also check out OpenBazaar project, if you are looking for alternatives.

BitWasp is not production ready
===

This project is very much under development, and not yet ready for an alpha. Please be aware the project has not yet underdone extensive security testing and the code is liable to change. Please download and test the code by all means, but don't complain if it does something unexpected.
